Photon Fusion Physics Addon - Release History

Last tested with Fusion SDK 2.0.5

Version 2.0.3
- Fix: Added safety check when despawning the NetworkRigidbody to avoid exceptions.
- Fix: Broken interpolation with interpolation target set and client physics disabled

Version 2.0.2
- Fix: local and world space mixing.
- Fix: Broken interpolation in shared mode with SyncParent enabled.

Version 2.0.1
- Fixed reset of Physics.autoSimulation after stopping all network runners.

Version 2.0.0
- Initial release.
- Replaced 'Is Forward' property on RunnerSimulatePhysics2D / RunnerSimulatePhysics3D by 'Client Physics Simulation'.
  This option allows you to specify behavior of physics simulation on clients. Option are:
    - Disabled        - physics simulation is not running and transforms are not synced (default).
    - SyncTransforms  - calls Physics.SyncTransforms() in all ticks.
    - SimulateForward - calls Physics.SyncTransforms() in resimulation ticks + Physics.Simulate() in forward ticks.
    - SimulateAlways  - calls Physics.Simulate() in all ticks.
