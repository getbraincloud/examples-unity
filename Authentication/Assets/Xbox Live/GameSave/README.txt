To use Connected Storage in your game, you need to first install "Xbox Live Platform Extensions SDK" from: http://aka.ms/xblextsdk

After installing the SDK, double click on the GameSave.unitypackage found at 'Assets\Xbox Live\GameSave\' to import the scripts and prefabs. To quickly test your integration, drag the 'GameSaveUI' prefab from the Prefabs folders and drop it into your scene.
