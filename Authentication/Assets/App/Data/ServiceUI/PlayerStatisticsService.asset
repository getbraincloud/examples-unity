  ServiceDescription: "The Player Statistics service is used for all user-scoped
    statistics operations, including Player Experience (XP).\n\nUser Stats must be
    pre-defined from the Statistics Rules \u2013 User Statistics page of the brainCloud
    portal. If instead you need to create them dynamically at runtime, you can enable
    the Generate User Statistic Rule Enabled setting on the Advanced Settings page
    of your app in the brainCloud portal."
