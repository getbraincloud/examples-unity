  ServiceDescription: "Custom Entities are very similar to Global Entities, but with
    several advanced features that make them more applicable for larger data sets.\n\nLike
    Global Entities, Custom Entites are:\r\n\u2022 available across all users of
    an app\r\n\u2022 access is controlled via ACL\r\n\u2022 have an entityType for
    organization\r\n\u2022 can have owners or be un-owned (as system objects)\r\n\u2022
    can be automatically deleted via TTL (time-to-live)\r\n\nCustom Entities differ
    in these ways:\r\n\u2022 You must pre-declare your entityTypes ahead-of-time\r\n\u2022
    You can create custom indexes for each entityType for fast lookups\r\n\u2022
    You can have an unlimited # of custom entities\r\n\u2022 You can do partial updates
    of custom entities\r\n\u2022 Custom entities support auto-migration during deployment\n\nNote
    \u2013 Custom Entities are a premium feature available to Plus Plan customers.
    Additional usage fees apply."
