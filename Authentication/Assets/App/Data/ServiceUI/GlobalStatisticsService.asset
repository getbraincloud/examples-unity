  ServiceDescription: "The Global Statistics service allows you to retrieve and update
    your app's predefined statistics defined on the Global Statistics page of the
    brainCloud portal.\n\nGlobal Statistics must be pre-defined from the Statistics
    Rules \u2013 Global Statistics page of the brainCloud portal. If instead you
    need to create them dynamically at runtime, you can enable the Generate App Statistic
    Rule Enabled setting on the Advanced Settings page of your app in the brainCloud
    portal.\n\nGlobal (or App) Statistics are similar to User Stats, except that
    they are stored centrally across all of an app's users."
