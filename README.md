# UnityExamples

This repository contains example Unity projects that use the brainCloud client â€” an excellent place to start learning how the various brainCloud APIs are used.

## Copying an example via templates

Some of our examples are a bit more complicated and require brainCloud dashboard side configurations.
These examples include Bombers, BombersRTT, SpaceShooterWithState, and TicTacToe.

Create a new app using a template of one of these examples.

In Unity select **brainCloud | Select Settings** from the menu.

<p align="center">
  <img  src="./screenshots/step_selectsettings.png?raw=true">
</p>

In the brainCloud Settings, login to your current account or signup for the first time. _brainCloud is free during development :)_

With your team selected, select **Create New App ...** and check **Create with template?**
Select the template you wish to use. If using the SpaceShooter example, check the SpaceShooter template.

<p align="center">
  <img  src="./screenshots/step_spaceshootertemplate.png?raw=true">
</p>

After creating the new app, you can review the imported data on the brainCloud dashboard. The SpaceShooter example imports stats which can be view on the **Design | Statistics Rules | [User Statistics](https://portal.braincloudservers.com/admin/dashboard?custom=null#/development/stats-player)** page.

### Enabling hosting on the BombersRTT example

The BombersRTT demonstrates an example using our relay server hosting.

This form of hosting requires our **plus** plans, so to entirely run the example on your copy, you need to enable the **DEVELOPMENT PLUS** plan or higher. Find the option on the **Team | Manage | [Apps](https://portal.braincloudservers.com/admin/dashboard#/support/apps)** page, and click **[Go Live!]**.

## Authentication

This example demonstrates how to call methods in the following modules:

-   Authentication

    -   Email
    -   Universal
    -   Anonymous
    -   Google - http://getbraincloud.com/apidocs/portal-usage/authentication-google/

-   Player Entities
-   XP/Currency
-   Player Statistics
-   Global Statistics
-   Cloud Code

You can find more information about how to run the example here:

## AuthenticationErrorHandling

This example demonstrates various error handling cases around authentication.
Use it to experiment with authentication error states.

## BombersRTT

Note: the BombersRTT example expects your app to have a [brainCloud plus plan enabled](#enabling-hosting-on-the-bombersrtt-example).

BombersRTT is a real-time multiplayer game implemented using brainCloud. brainCloud provides the backend services for storing data, as well as the Matchmaking and brainCloud's Relay Multiplayer server.

[Demo Link](http://apps.braincloudservers.com/bombersrtt-demo/index.html)

For more information, see this [README.mb](https://github.com/getbraincloud/examples-unity/blob/master/BombersRTT/README.md) file.

**Note** Compiler Flags

-   DEBUG_LOG_ENABLED - Enable logs via GDebug Class.
-   STEAMWORKS_ENABLED - Enable Steam SDK integration, must have the steam client open on a desktop to use via the editor
-   BUY_CURRENCY_ENABLED - Enable store product purchasing. PC / Mac / standalone builds require STEAMWORKS_ENABLED flag

### Additonal information

This code example is based on the Firebase Unity Quickstart Project
https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-unity

Can see more FCM documentation here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client

Project currently only contains a push notifications example for Android FCM

-   Add your google-services.json file to the asset folder. Found on the Firebase dashboard
-   Update the brainCloud AppId and Secret on BrainCloudSettings to match yours. Id and Secret found on the brainCloud Dashboard
-   Download and import the Auth and Messaging Firebase Unity SDK
